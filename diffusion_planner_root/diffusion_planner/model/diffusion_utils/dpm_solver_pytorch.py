        The forward SDE ensures that the condition distribution q_{t|0}(x_t | x_0) = N ( alpha_t * x_0, sigma_t^2 * I ).
        We further define lambda_t = log(alpha_t) - log(sigma_t), which is the half-logSNR (described in the DPM-Solver paper).
        Therefore, we implement the functions for computing alpha_t, sigma_t and lambda_t. For t in [0, T], we have:

            log_alpha_t = self.marginal_log_mean_coeff(t)
            sigma_t = self.marginal_std(t)
            lambda_t = self.marginal_lambda(t)

        Moreover, as lambda(t) is an invertible function, we also support its inverse function:

            t = self.inverse_lambda(lambda_t)

    """Create a wrapper function for the noise prediction model.

    DPM-Solver needs to solve the continuous-time diffusion ODEs. For DPMs trained on discrete-time labels, we need to
    firstly wrap the model function to a noise prediction model that accepts the continuous time as the input.

    We support four types of the diffusion model by setting `model_type`:

        1. "noise": noise prediction model. (Trained by predicting noise).

        2. "x_start": data prediction model. (Trained by predicting the data x_0 at time 0).

        3. "v": velocity prediction model. (Trained by predicting the velocity).
            The "v" prediction is derivation detailed in Appendix D of [1], and is used in Imagen-Video [2].

                arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.02303 (2022).

        4. "score": marginal score function. (Trained by denoising score matching).
            Note that the score function and the noise prediction model follows a simple relationship:
            ```
                noise(x_t, t) = -sigma_t * score(x_t, t)
            ```

    We support three types of guided sampling by DPMs by setting `guidance_type`:
        1. "uncond": unconditional sampling by DPMs.
            The input `model` has the following format:
            ``
                model(x, t_input, **model_kwargs) -> noise | x_start | v | score
            ``

        2. "classifier": classifier guidance sampling [3] by DPMs and another classifier.
            The input `model` has the following format:
            ``
                model(x, t_input, **model_kwargs) -> noise | x_start | v | score
            ``

            The input `classifier_fn` has the following format:
            ``
                classifier_fn(x, t_input, cond, **classifier_kwargs) -> logits(x, t_input, cond)
            ``

                in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, vol. 34, 2021, pp. 8780-8794.

        3. "classifier-free": classifier-free guidance sampling by conditional DPMs.
            The input `model` has the following format:
            ``
                model(x, t_input, cond, **model_kwargs) -> noise | x_start | v | score
            ``
            And if cond == `unconditional_condition`, the model output is the unconditional DPM output.

                arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.12598 (2022).


    The `t_input` is the time label of the model, which is continuous-time labels (i.e. epsilon to T).

    We wrap the model function to accept only `x` and `t_continuous` as inputs, and outputs the predicted noise:
    ``
        def model_fn(x, t_continuous) -> noise:
            t_input = get_model_input_time(t_continuous)
            return noise_pred(model, x, t_input, **model_kwargs)
    ``
    where `t_continuous` is the continuous time labels (i.e. epsilon to T). And we use `model_fn` for DPM-Solver.

        Compute the sample at time `t_end` by DPM-Solver, given the initial `x` at time `t_start`.

        =====================================================

        We support the following algorithms for both noise prediction model and data prediction model:
            - 'multistep':
                Multistep DPM-Solver with the order of `order`. The total number of function evaluations (NFE) == `steps`.
                We initialize the first `order` values by lower order multistep solvers.
                Given a fixed NFE == `steps`, the sampling procedure is:
                    Denote K = steps.
                    - We firstly use 1 step of DPM-Solver-1, then use (K - 1) step of multistep DPM-Solver-2.

        =====================================================

        Some advices for choosing the algorithm:
            - For **unconditional sampling** or **guided sampling with small guidance scale** by DPMs:
                Use singlestep DPM-Solver++ ("DPM-Solver-fast" in the paper) with `order = 3`.
                e.g., DPM-Solver++:
                    >>> dpm_solver = DPM_Solver(model_fn, noise_schedule)
                    >>> x_sample = dpm_solver.sample(x, steps=steps, order=3,
                            skip_type='time_uniform', method='singlestep')
            - For **guided sampling with large guidance scale** by DPMs:
                Use multistep DPM-Solver with `order = 2`.
                e.g.
                    >>> dpm_solver = DPM_Solver(model_fn, noise_schedule)
                    >>> x_sample = dpm_solver.sample(x, steps=steps, order=2,
                            skip_type='time_uniform', method='multistep')

        We support three types of `skip_type`:
            - 'logSNR': uniform logSNR for the time steps. **Recommended for low-resolutional images**
            - 'time_uniform': uniform time for the time steps. **Recommended for high-resolutional images**.
            - 'time_quadratic': quadratic time for the time steps.

        =====================================================

            steps: A `int`. The total number of function evaluations (NFE).
            skip_type: A `str`. The type for the spacing of the time steps. 'time_uniform' or 'logSNR' or 'time_quadratic'.
        Returns:
